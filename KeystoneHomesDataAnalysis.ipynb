        "- The model showed a positive but small relationship between enrollment and rent. For every 1,000 additional international students, rent increased by approximately $2.\n",
        "- The model’s R² score was 0.40, meaning international student enrollment explains about 40% of the variation in rent prices across city-years.\n",
        "- While this suggests a moderate correlation, it also indicates that other factors play a larger role in determining rent trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, international student presence appears to be one of several contributing factors to rising rents, but not a dominant one on its own."

        "\n",
        "### 1. Don't rely on enrollment alone\n",
        "- International student growth gives us some insight, but it’s only part of the bigger picture.\n",
        "- We can combine it with other drivers like job growth, income trends, and housing supply.\n",
        "- It should be a supporting factor, not the core of a rent forecast.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Focus on cities where enrollment is climbing\n",
        "- Rising international enrollment can signal stronger demand.\n",
        "- By tracking city and school-level trends, we can spot opportunities earlier.\n",
        "- Focus on places where student growth is moving faster than housing supply.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Add more layers to the analysis\n",
        "- International students explain some of the rent changes — but not everything.\n",
        "- We should pull in data on incomes, new construction, and employment to get a fuller picture.\n",
        "- A multi-factor model will lead to stronger investment and planning decisions.\n",
